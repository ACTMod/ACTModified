    .SYNOPSIS
        Downloads critial files required to run the Get-LinkPerformance command in the Azure Connectivity Toolkit.

    .DESCRIPTION
        To enable the Get-LinkPerformance command to run succesfully, certain third party applications are
        needed as well as local host configurations. The Install-LinkPerformance command will download and
        configure these requirements.

        This command only needs to be run once for a given host. However if required files are deleted or
        the host is configured so that Get-LinkPerformance can't run successfully you will be prompted to
        run Install-LinkPerformance again to get the host enabled for successfull testing.

        When called, this cmdlet will perform the following step:
        1. Create a C:\ACTTools directory
        2. Download iPerf3 files to the directory
        3. Download PSPing to the directory
        4. Download two files from GitHub (a firewalls rule script, and a readme file)
        5. Accept the EULA for PSPing
        6. Open the local host firewall for ICMP and Port 5201 traffic

    .PARAMETER Force
        This optional parameter will bypass the "Are you sure" prompt and enable a silent or scripted installation.

    .EXAMPLE
        Install-LinkPerformance

        This command will prompt the user to ensure they accept the changes performed by this installation. If conditions
        are accepted, the installation continues, if not accepted, the installation ends with no changes make to the host.

    .EXAMPLE
        Install-LinkPerformance -Force

        This command will bypass the user prompt and begin the installation and configuration changes.
